Cassandra Basics:

Distributed NoSQL Database: Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed, and decentralized database system designed for handling large amounts of data across multiple commodity servers.
Data Model:

Cassandra uses a wide-column store data model.
Data is organized into tables, rows, and columns, similar to a traditional relational database.
Key Concepts:

Node: A single Cassandra instance/server.
Cluster: A group of nodes that store your data.
Keyspace: A namespace that defines data replication and settings.
Table: The primary data structure for storing data in Cassandra.
Column Family: A collection of related columns within a table.
Data Distribution:

Data is distributed across nodes using a partition key (a hash of the primary key).
The partition key determines the node responsible for storing the data.
Replication:

Cassandra replicates data across multiple nodes for fault tolerance.
The replication factor determines how many copies of the data are stored.
Consistency:

Cassandra provides tunable consistency levels, allowing you to choose how consistent you want your reads and writes to be.
Data Types:

Cassandra supports various data types, including text, integer, float, boolean, timestamp, UUID, and more.
CQL (Cassandra Query Language):

CQL is the query language for Cassandra, similar to SQL.
Use CQL to create, retrieve, update, and delete data.
Data Modeling:

Denormalize data to optimize read performance.
Model data based on your query patterns.
Avoid using too many secondary indexes, as they can impact write performance.
Compaction:

Compaction is the process of merging and compacting SSTables to improve read performance.
Tombstones:

Cassandra uses tombstones to mark deleted data, and they are removed during compaction.
Nodetool:

Nodetool is a command-line utility for managing and monitoring Cassandra nodes.
Architecture:

Cassandra has a masterless, peer-to-peer architecture with no single point of failure.
Data Centers:

Cassandra can be deployed across multiple data centers for high availability and disaster recovery.
Security:

Cassandra provides authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your data.
Integration:

Cassandra can be integrated with various tools and frameworks, including Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.
Datastax Enterprise (DSE):

DataStax provides DataStax Enterprise, a distribution of Cassandra with additional features and support.
Community Support:

Cassandra has a strong open-source community and extensive documentation.
Please note that Cassandra is a powerful and complex database system, and this cheat sheet provides a basic overview. For detailed information and best practices, refer to the official Cassandra documentation and consider your specific use case.
